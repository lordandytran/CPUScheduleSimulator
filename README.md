# CPUScheduleSimulator
CPU Event Schedule Simulation
Simulates different algorithms used for CPU event scheduling.

Author: Andy Tran
Language: C++
IDE: Visual Studio

Code Files:

CPUEvent.h
- Defines the CPUEvent class.
- Defines the number of CPU events used in the simulation as a global 

LinkedListQueue.h
- Defines the LinkedListQueue class used in each algorithm

Source.cpp
- Main function. Contains the algorithms used for scheduling
- Creates an array of CPU events to schedule
- Goes thorugh 5 algorithms and outputs to txt files
- Simulates the order that the processes are scheduled and the average wait time
